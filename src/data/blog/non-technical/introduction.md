  "This is a really bad and a really long joke. This is your last chance, stop while you can"

Three guys are walking in a desert, not really stranded just vibing. While walking one of them notices a genie lamp, and upon rubbing the genie lamp out pops a genie. "**Thank you mortals, you have freed me from my infernal prison. I have been locked inside for a thousand years, as a reward I'll grant each of you three wishes!"** The genie proclaims, happy to have finally been freed.

The three guys eye him suspiciously, it's not everyday you see a mythical creature pop out of a lamp. They eye each back and forth to make sure they are seeing the same thing before the first guys says, "I want to have a million... no a billion dollars!" The genie nonchalantly snaps his fingers and says "Done." The guys opens his banking app and notices it says '1,000,000,600' and his eyes almost pop out of his head. 

The geniue turns to the second guy, "And you, what do you want?" he asks. The second guy excitedly replies "I want to be the richest guy on earth!" and once again the genie snaps his finger and says "Done!", he opens his banking app and notices it says '500,000,003,000' and lets out a cheer in excitement.

The genie then again turns to the third guy, "What is your wish?", the third guy pauses for a minute, his hand resting on his chin as he ponders. "I want my right arm to always turn counter clockwise 24/7" he finally says. The genie raises an eyebrow but eventually snaps his finger and says "Done," and the third guy's right arm is now turning counter clockwise on it's own.

He then turns to face the first guy again, "What do you want for your second wish?" The guy doesn't wait a second and immediately replying "I want to be married to the hottest woman on earth who loves me and will never leave me," The genie snaps his fingers and once again says "Done," and poof pop a breathtakingly beautiful girl next to the guy who immediately wraps her arms around him and kisses him on the cheek.

Before the genie can turn to the other guy he yells out his second wish, "I wish to be irresistable to all women!" he exclaims excitedly and the genie snaps his finger again, "Done," he says and immediately we notice the difference, his jaw becomes more chiseled, his eyes sharper, his body leaner and more refined, his thinning hair gaining volume, his height gaining a few inches. None of the changes are major but all the changes combined make a noticeable effect and the first guy's wife is already giving him looks.

The genie then turns to the third guy, unsure what to expect as the first answer was already puzzling. "What would you like for your second wish?" He asks and the third guy responds "I want my left arm to be turning clockwise 24/7" he responds confidently this time, the genie once again raises an eyebrow in confusion but he's not one to judge. He snaps his fingers and says "Done," and already the third guy's left arm is turning clockwise while his right arm is turning anti clockwise.

He then turns to first guy again, "And for your final wish?" he asks. The guy responds "For my final wish I want to forever be 30 years old and never get sick," The genie snaps his fingers and says "Done," and the guy already feels better, the aching knees no longer bother him and his back straightening fixing his bad posture from years of office work.

He then turns to the second guy who says "I want to always be healthy and be at an olympic level of physical prowess," the genie nods his head in approval and snaps his finger, "Done," and we immediately the muscle mass improving on the second guy, his back widening, abs start to pop out, biceps and vascularity clearly showing, and thighs and calves growing in mass. The second guy puffs his big chest proudly.

The genie then faces the third guy, who's arms are spinning now, unsure what to expect. "I want my head to shake left and right 24/7" he says and the genie decides it's not worth to ask why, he just snaps his fingers and says "Done," and the third guy's head starts shaking left and right while both his arms keep spinning. Having finished the wishes the genie says "I have fulfilled my debt and granted your wishes, best of luck in your journey mortals" before teleporting back to his mythical realm and disappearing from their sight.

Excited at their new wishes, the guys eventually get home and meet up a year later. The first guy says "Man ever since I got a billion dollars in my account I told my boss to go screw himself, quit my job, got a property by the beach where I can do what I want and spend time with my beautiful wife," He says unable to contain his excitement. The second guy also happily follows, "My life also turned around, ever since I became the richest guy on earth I've become a philanthropist, helping so many people around the world and making a real difference. And the best thing about all this philanthropy and money and looks is that I got so much fame every day I'm sleeping with a different model or celebrity," He flaunts his confidence peaking. Finally they both turn to the third guy, his head still shaking left and right, his left arm spinning clockwise while his right arm spins anti clockwise, who then mumbles, "Guys, I think I fucked up"
