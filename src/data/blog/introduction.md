I am a **Machine Learning Researcher** and **Senior Data Scientist** based in **Munich, Germany**.

Currently, I am completing my **M.Sc. in Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, while researching **Multimodal Deep Learning** and **Uncertainty Quantification** at **LIS Lab** (Marseille).

My work sits at the intersection of **rigorous academic research** and **scalable engineering**. I don't just build models; I deploy them to solve real-world efficiency problems.

### 🔬 Research Focus
I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Legal Tech**. My research has been published in top-tier conferences like **COLING** and **LREC-COLING**, accumulating over **40+ citations** to date.

* **Multimodal Learning:** Developing novel fusion methods to estimate uncertainty in deep learning models.
* **Legal NLP:** Achieved state-of-the-art results on the BSARD dataset (Recall@500 to 91.3%) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
* **Disentanglement:** Leveraging information-theoretic approaches (InfoNCE, VAEs) to disentangle data modalities.

### 🛠️ Engineering Experience
Prior to my Master's, I spent 4+ years as a Data Scientist in fast-paced tech environments:

* **Mtor (Senior Data Scientist):** Built the company's entire data infrastructure from scratch (PostgreSQL/Redash) and directed 1000+ monthly commercial purchases via demand forecasting.
* **Swvl (Data Scientist):** Deployed multivariate time-series forecasting models (Gradient Boosting) that reduced RMSE by 13%, serving millions of customers.
* **Maxab:** Optimized vehicle dispatching using Python (PuLP), reducing planning time by 85%.

### 💻 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL
* **DL/ML:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, GNNs, XGBoost
* **Ops:** Docker, Airflow, AWS, Google Cloud Platform
