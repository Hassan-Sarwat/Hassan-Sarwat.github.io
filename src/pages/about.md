Hello, I'm Hassan,a **Machine Learning Researcher** and **Senior Data Scientist** based in **Munich, Germany**.

I have recently finished my **M.Sc. in Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, I enjoy working on both industry problems and academic research because we grow by learning and I love to learn about everything unfortunately.

### 🔬 Research Focus
I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and traditional **Machine Learning**. My research has been published in top-tier conferences like **COLING** and **LREC-COLING**, accumulating over **40+ citations** to date.

* [**Multimodal Learning:**](https://github.com/Hassan-Sarwat/disentagled_multimodal_fusion) Developed a novel fusion methods to estimate uncertainty in deep learning models using disentanglement.
* [**Graph Neural Networks:**](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.100/) Achieved state-of-the-art results on the BSARD dataset (Recall@500 to 91.3%) using heterogenous GNNs and **Knowledge Distillation** 
* [**Contrastive Learning**](https://https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.987/): Improved SotA across multiple datasets by avg 5% using novel contrastive learning methods such as discourse aware contrastive learning and memory bank. 
* [**XGBoost**](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/21/6948): Using XGBoost and data from sensors, was able to create a recovery scale for post-stroke patients to better asses recovery instead of previously used binary selection (recovered/not recovered).

### 🛠️ Engineering Experience
Prior to my Master's, I spent 4+ years as a Data Scientist in fast-paced tech environments:
* **Incuda (Working Student)**: Created dashboards on PowerBI, developed AI agents for automated powerpoint creation for competitor analysis using langchain and data from web scrapers. 
* **Mtor (Senior Data Scientist):** Built the company's entire data infrastructure from scratch (PostgreSQL/Redash) and directed 1000+ monthly commercial purchases via demand forecasting.
* **Swvl (Data Scientist):** Deployed multivariate time-series forecasting models (Gradient Boosting) that reduced RMSE by 13%, serving millions of customers.
* **Maxab:** Optimized vehicle dispatching using Python (PuLP), reducing planning time by 85%, created a customer segmentation model with 97% accuracy that enabled better decision making for all departments, and created an algorithm to match customer with the best promotion achieving a 70% conversion rate.

### 💻 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL
* **DL/ML:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, GNNs, XGBoost, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google-Genai, Contrastive Learning, LLMs, Existential Dread. 
* **Ops:** Docker, Airflow, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Github
