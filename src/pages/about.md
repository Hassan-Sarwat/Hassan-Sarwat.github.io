Hello, I'm Hassan, a **Machine Learning Researcher** and **Senior Data Scientist** based in **Munich, Germany**.

I have recently finished my **M.Sc. in Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, I enjoy working on both industry problems and academic research.

I am genuinely looking to grow, whether it's gaining more experience in production environments or working in a more research-focused setting, I love startups or companies with startup-like culture and horizontal hierarchies. I just like solving problems.

### 🛠️ Engineering Experience
Prior to my Master's, I spent 4+ years as a Data Scientist in fast-paced tech environments:


**Business Analyst (Part Time) - Incuda (May 2023 - January 2025)** 
- Developed an autonomous AI Agent using LangChain to automate competitor analysis, integrating web scrapers and LLM-based reporting.
- Engineered robust SQL unit tests to ensure data integrity and resolved quality issues across disparate data sources.
- Developed comprehensive PowerBI dashboards for marketing teams to track campaign performance

**Senior Data Scientist - Mtor (August 2022 - August 2023)** 
- Architected the company’s central data warehouse using PostgreSQL and Redash, enabling real-time analytics for 100+ agents.
- Mentored junior analysts and communicated closely with co-founders providing ad-hoc data analysis when needed or as requested from investors.
- Engineered a Multi-Vehicle Routing Optimization system using Google OR-Tools to streamline logistics across the supply chain.
- Built production Demand Forecasting models using XGBoost, directly guiding purchasing decisions.

**Data Scientist - Swvl (August 2021 - August 2022)** 
- Developed a Deep Learning demand model (LSTM & Gradient Boosting) that reduced RMSE by 13% vs. legacy methods.
- Deployed Time-Series models using Docker and Kubernetes, establishing CI/CD pipelines and monitoring performance via Airflow
- Optimized BigQuery queries used to predict demand hour based on user behavior on the app, reducing cloud computation cost by 90%
- Founded Data Governance Team to standardize metric definitions across the organization
- Experimented with different methodologies when developing multiple time series models, using Statistical methods like ARIMA, machine learning methods like Gradient Boosting, and Deep learning methods like LSTM

**Data Scientist - Maxab (October 2019 - July 2021)** 
- Assisted our commercial, marketing, and acquisition team by building and deploying a customer segmentation model using XGBoost achieving 97% accuracy.
- Led in Daily/Monthly KPI review meetings, regularly presenting dashboards I created to analytics team and entire organization, using data insights to identify bottlenecks and strategize next steps.
- Coordinated with the marketing team and used python to design a campaign targeting program that assigned our weekly offers to the customers, achieving a 40% conversion rate.
- Built a vehicle dispatch optimization model that automated our daily route planning and reduced human involvement time by 90%

### 🔬 Research Experience

I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and traditional **Machine Learning**. My research has been published in conferences like **LREC-COLING** and one journal publication with **Sensors** accumulating over **40+ citations** to date.

**[Research Intern](https://github.com/Hassan-Sarwat/disentagled_multimodal_fusion) - LIS Labs (January 2025 - July 2025)**
- Applied Uncertainty quantification with Multimodal Learning using Evidential Neural Networks
- Created a novel Late Fusion method for Uncertainty Quantification using Disentanglement to better estimate uncertainty in partly dependent modalities
- Implemented state-of-the-art research papers in Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning to benchmark performance
- Experimented with different Disentanglement methods using information theoretical approaches (InfoNCE / Contrastive Learning) and Variational AutoEncoder Approaches

**[QABISAR: Query-Article Bipartite Interactions for Statutory Article Retrieval](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.100/) - COLING (January 2025)**

- Developed a novel GNN framework in PyTorch for legal article retrieval, modeling complex query-article relationships to overcome semantic mismatch issues
- Applied knowledge distillation to transfer rich semantics from the GNN (teacher) to a bi-encoder (student), boosting performance on unseen queries
- Achieved state-of-the-art results on the BSARD dataset, improving Recall@500 to 91.3%

**[Mind Your Neighbours: Leveraging Analogous Instances for Rhetorical Role Labeling for Legal Documents](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.987/) - LREC (May 2024)**

- Enhanced legal text classification by implementing supervised contrastive learning in PyTorch to create more discriminative sentence embeddings for rhetorical roles.
- Invented a novel discourse-aware contrastive loss that leverages sentence proximity within legal documents to significantly improve the model’s performance
- Boosted the challenging macro-F1 score by over 15% (from 62.43 to 71.99) on the Paheli dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art for contrastive methods on the task

**[Design of a Data Glove for Assessment of Hand Performance Using Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/21/6948) - Sensors (October 2021)**

- Developed an IoT-based automated assessment system for in-home stroke rehabilitation, integrating a custom wearable data glove (Flex sensors, FSRs, IMUs) with a mobile application and cloud infrastructure.
- Implemented and evaluated Supervised Machine Learning models (XGBoost and Logistic Regression) to classify hand motor function, achieving 85% accuracy through rigorous feature extraction and hyperparameter tuning.
- Engineered a scalable backend API using Python Flask and Firebase Realtime Database to enable remote patient monitoring, ensuring seamless data synchronization between the embedded device, mobile app, and web server.

If you've made it this far I like to read, a lot, mainly fantasy, but recently started branching out to other genres. I like board games and dungeons and dragons. I don't say no to sports and like to move except maybe running. Sometimes I like jumping in the ice cold water. I enjoy a good movie every now and then. My favorite hobbies are making people laugh at the wrong time and giving questionable advice.
