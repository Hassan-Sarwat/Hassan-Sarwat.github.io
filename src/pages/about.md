Hello, I'm Hassan, a **Machine Learning Researcher** and **Senior Data Scientist** based in **Munich, Germany**.

I have recently finished my **M.Sc. in Data Engineering and Analytics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, I enjoy working on both industry problems and academic research because we grow by learning and I love to learn about everything unfortunately. 

### 🛠️ Engineering Experience
Prior to my Master's, I spent 4+ years as a Data Scientist in fast-paced tech environments:

**Research - LIS Labs (January 2025 - July 2025)**
- Applied Uncertainty quantification with Multimodal Learning using Evidential Neural Networks
- Created a novel Late Fusion method for Uncertainty Quantification using Disentanglement to better estimate uncertainty in partly dependent modalities
- Implemented state-of-the-art research papers in Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning to benchmark performance
- Experimented with different Disentanglement methods using information theoretical approaches (InfoNCE / Contrastive Learning) and Variational AutoEncoder Approaches

**Business Analyist - Incuda (May 2023 - January 2025)** 
- Developed an autonomous AI Agent using LangChain to automate competitor analysis, integrating web scrapers and LLM-based reporting.
- Engineered robust SQL unit tests to ensure data integrity and resolved quality issues across disparate data sources.
- Developed comprehensive PowerBI dashboards for marketing teams to track campaign performance

**Senior Data Scientist - Mtor (August 2022 - August 2023)** 
- Architected the company’s central data warehouse using PostgreSQL and Redash, enabling real-time analytics for 100+ agents.
- Mentored junior analysts and communicated closely with co-founders providing ad-hoc data analysis when needed
or as requested from investors.
- Engineered a Multi-Vehicle Routing Optimization system using Google OR-Tools to streamline logistics across the supply chain.
- Built production Demand Forecasting models using XGBoost, directly guiding purchasing decisions.

**Data Scientist - Swvl (August 2021 - August 2022)** 
- Developed a Deep Learning demand model (LSTM & Gradient Boosting) that reduced RMSE by 13% vs. legacy methods.
- Deployed Time-Series models using Docker and Kubernetes, establishing CI/CD pipelines and monitoring performance via Airflow
- Optimized BigQuery queries used to predict demand hour based on user behavior on the app, reducing cloud computation cost by 90%
- Founded Data Governance Team to standardize metric definitions across the organization
- Experimented with different methodologies when developing multiple time series models, using Statistical methods like ARIMA, machine learning methods like Gradient Boosting, and Deep learning methods like LSTM

**Data Scientist - Maxab (October 2019 - July 2021)** 
- Assisted our commercial, marketing, and acquisition team by building and deploying a customer segmentation model using XGBoost achieving 97% accuracy.
- Led in Daily/Monthly KPI review meetings, regularly presenting dashboards I created to analytics team and entire organization, using data insights to identify bottlenecks and strategize next steps.
- Coordinated with the marketing team and used python to design a campaign targeting program that assigned our weekly offers to the customers, achieving a 40% conversion rate.
- Built a vehicle dispatch optimization model that automated our daily route planning and reduced human involvement time by 90%


### 🔬 Research Focus
I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and traditional **Machine Learning**. My research has been published in conferences like **LREC-COLING** and journal like **Sensors** accumulating over **40+ citations** to date.

* [**Multimodal Learning:**](https://github.com/Hassan-Sarwat/disentagled_multimodal_fusion) Developed a novel fusion methods to estimate uncertainty in deep learning models using disentanglement.
* [**Graph Neural Networks:**](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.100/) Achieved state-of-the-art results on the BSARD dataset (Recall@500 to 91.3%) using heterogenous GNNs and **Knowledge Distillation** 
* [**Contrastive Learning**](https://https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.987/): Improved SotA across multiple datasets by avg 5% using novel contrastive learning methods such as discourse aware contrastive learning and memory bank. 
* [**XGBoost**](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/21/6948): Using XGBoost and data from sensors, was able to create a recovery scale for post-stroke patients to better asses recovery instead of previously used binary selection (recovered/not recovered).
